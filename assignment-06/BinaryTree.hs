-- Complexity O(n^2) as this essentially expands to something like the following:
-- e : [x:xs] ++ [y:ys]
-- Since the list concatination of n elements takes O(n), rather than O(1), the
-- running time of the algorithm is O(n^2), as this concatination is executed on
-- each recursive call.

-- Complexity O(n^2) as this essentially expands to something like the following:
-- [x:xs] ++ [e] ++ [y:ys]
-- Concatinating the element e is not a problem, but concatinating the list [x:xs]
-- of n elements will take O(n), rather than O(1). Therefore the running time of

-- Complexity O(n) as this essentially expands to something like the following:

-- Since only 1 element is appended with each list concat, this happens in
-- constant time. As all n elements appear (plus some empty leafs), the running

-- Since tree of size n can be transformed into a tree of size 2n+1 in one step
-- it's possible to roughly double the size with each step. Hence it's possible
-- to produce a tree of size ~2^n in n steps, which means it's possible to
-- produce a tree of size n in log(n) steps.
-- works for (2^n)-1, would require some modifications to produce exactly n
-- nodes, but this would not change the running time complexity.
