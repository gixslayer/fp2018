Prefix notation is easy to parse, because once you read the operator you know how many operands/expressions you need to parse next.
Prefix notation is tricky when you'd like to use operators that can have different meanings depending on the amount of operands (such as unary - vs binary -).
Postfix notation is easy to evaluate using a stack, for example 1 2 3 + 4 + pushes numbers, and once a + is encountered it pops the top 2 elements on the stack, computes the result and pushes that onto the stack.
Postfix feels really unintuitive to mentally parse, unlike infix notation, but perhaps that is simply because we're taught infix notation as children.

Because we (Westerners) read from left to right, 5 - 4 - 2 reads as take 5, subtract 4 and then subtract 2, thus left associates.
Evaluating it as right associative yields 5 - (4 - 2) = 3, which forces you to read from right to left and goes against the normal left associative definition in math.

While ("F" ++ "P") ++ "1" and "F" ++ ("P" ++ "1") both yield "FP1", I suppose it is right associative because of efficiency/performance reasons.

The $ operator can be useful to avoid parentheses, eg 'f $ "Hello, " ++ name' instead of 'f ("Hello, " ++ name)'

((1 x 1) x 0) = 3 x 0 = 6
(1 x (1 x 0)) = 1 x 2 = 4

When you declare the operator as right associative it does not produce the expected value of 6 for the binary sequence '110'. Left associative evaluation does produce the expected value of 6, hence the choice for infixl.
(Because each application of ⊗ we have to shift the left bits one
place to the left (2*a). If we define infixr we do not shift all the
left bits to the left, eg. 1⊗0⊗1⊗0 would be 5 instead of 11.)

f x >= 0 && a || g x y ∗ 7 + 10 == b − 5

After explicitly adding all parentheses:
(((f x) >= 0) && a) || (((((g x) y) ∗ 7) + 10) == (b − 5))
