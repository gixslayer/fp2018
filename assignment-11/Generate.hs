-- The following also works
--lists = flip replicateM
-- as lists expands to:
--lists elems count = foldr (\xs yss -> [x : ys | x <- xs, ys <- yss]) [[]] (replicate count elems)
{-
  For each list xs in the arguments for the cartesian product:
    For each elem x of list xs:
      For each list ys in the accumulator list yss:
        Append elem x to list ys

    So basically: concatenate each elem to all lists of the accumulator,
      and the resulting list becomes the new accumulator
